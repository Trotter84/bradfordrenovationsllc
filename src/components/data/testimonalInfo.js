    quote: '"Bradford Renovations has done an extensive amount of work for us. Two full beautiful bathrooms, kitchen, flooring, well-crafted molding and trim, superb painting and thorough cleanup. Their crew was always personable but professional, willing to adjust to a somewhat picky homeowner! Our projects all turned out better than we could have hoped. We felt involved, respected for our opinions, and happy with the results of a job fairly priced and well done. We would recommend Bradford Renovations for whatever need you may have."'
